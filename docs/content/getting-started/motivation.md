I think motivation is important, and in the past few month's I'm pursue a big picture.

The big picture is to standardise a architecture for Web Apps that are related, 
or a family of web apps, in a microservice like inspiration.

You can find clues about it in this projects:

* [Audit]
* [Spring SPA]
* [Notification Server]

Have fun ;-)
