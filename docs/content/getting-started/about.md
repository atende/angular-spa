[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atende/angular-spa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atende/angular-spa)

Utilities, classes and components for Angular Single Page Applications. Focus on enterprise use cases like
authentication and authorisation.

Is used by the generator
[spring-spa](https://github.com/giovannicandido/generator-spring-spa), but is a independent project and you can use
on its own.

Each module has its documentation. Usually you import the module and provide
some configuration and implementations for optional parts.

* [Auth Module](authentication-and-authorisation)
