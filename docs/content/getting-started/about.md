# angular-spa

[![Build Status][bimage]][bstatus]

Standard common chalenges in Single Pages Applications with angular solved.

This project can be used standalone or in full stack project, generated by

[spring-spa](https://github.com/giovannicandido/generator-spring-spa) yeoman generator, designed specifically to merge Spring and Angular


What you get?

* User account service. This user service loads information about the current login in user. Intentionally
you don't have things for user management like: create, update, password reset, because my projects use
a separate Single Sign On server [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) that ships with all and way more.
* Directives for security template display. This let you conditionally display user UI elements
based on user roles and authorities.
* Interceptors - Common use case for interceptors like: Dialog for messages, ajaxtimeout

I recommend check [angular-http-interceptor](https://github.com/giovannicandido/angular-http-interceptor)
for other usefull project.
