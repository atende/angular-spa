# angular-spa

Standard common chalenges in Single Pages Applications with angular solved.

This project can be used standalone or in full stack project, generated by

[spring-spa](https://github.com/giovannicandido/generator-spring-spa) yeoman generator, designed specifically to merge Spring and Angular

What you get?

* User account service. This user service loads information about the current login in user. Intentionally
you don't have things for user management like: create, update, password reset, because my projects use
a separate Single Sign On server [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) that ships with all and way more.
* Directives for security template display. This let you conditionally display user UI elements
based on user roles and authorities.
* Interceptors - Common use case for interceptors like: Dialog for messages, ajaxtimeout

I recommend check [angular-http-interceptor](https://github.com/giovannicandido/angular-http-interceptor)
for other usefull project.

# Motivation

I think motivation is important, and in the past few month's I'm pursue a big picture.

The big picture is to standardise a architeture for Web Apps that are related, 
or a family of web apps.

You can find clues about it in this projects:

* [Audit]
* [Spring SPA]
* [Notification Server]

Have fun ;-)
